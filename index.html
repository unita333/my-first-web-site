<h2>WEB</H2>

<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
system enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed
over the Internet.[1]

Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through
web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers.
Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through
character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original and
still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded
video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex
user interaction. The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs)
which provide immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation,
or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across
multiple websites. Web applications are web pages that function as
application software. The information in the Web is transferred across
he Internet using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>
